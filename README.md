# Classic Arcade Game Project

## Project Summary

This is my submission for Udacity's Classic Arcade Game Project for the FE Web Development Nanodegree. This is a basic "Frogger" style game where the goal is to reach a certain destination while avoding a fleet of enemies that cross the screen.

## Getting Started

Download the files in this repository and open the 'index.html' file. Opening this file will automatically start the game if all game files have been downloaded and maintained within their designated directories.

## Game Rules

* The Player spawns at the bottom of the Game Canvas and must reach the top row of tiles in order to win the game.
* While the Player is trying to reach the top row, Enemy bugs will cross the screen.
* If an Enemy bug runs into the Player, the Player will have lost the game and a "Game Over!" screen will appear.
* If the player successfully reaches the top row of tiles, the PLayer will have won the game and a "You Won!" screen will appear.
* Once the game has either been won or lost, the user can choose to refresh the browser in order to play again.
